# Regarding Other Similar File Formats

See the https://github.com/07th-mod/enter_extractor repository for a extractor which handles the newer file formats used by the same company.

# PS3Umi Extract Tool

This tool extracts the assets of Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Majo to Suiri no Rondo and Shinjitsu to Gensou no Nocturne) released for PS3. As far as I know this tool cannot extract the assets from the PSP version.

## Usage

```
Usage: ps3umi.exe DATA.ROM directory
    Extracts contents of ps3 umineko archive into directory
Usage: ps3umi.exe file.pic file.bmp
    Converts ps3 umineko picture file.pic to windows bitmap file.bmp
Usage: ps3umi.exe file.bup file
    Creates multiple windows bitmap files named file<emotion name>.bmp
    from ps3 umineko character sprite file.bup
Usage:  file.txa file
    Creates multiple windows bitmap files named file_<sub-title>.bmp
    from ps3 umineko picture collection file.txa
```
